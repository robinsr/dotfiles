# FOR REFERENCE
#   - WINDOW = an application window
#   - SPACE = a macOS Space; sequential desktops arranged horizontally
#   - DISPLAY = laptop screen or external monitor

# General Hotkey Patterns
#
# - Changing focus: Shift + Alt (option) + [key]
# - Moving windows: "Meh" (shift + alt + ctrl) + [key]
#
# - within a SPACE: Vim up/down (J and K)
# - across a SPACE: Vim left/right (H and L)
# - across a SCREEN: open-bracket/close-bracket (0x21 and 0x1E)
#
# Directions:
#
#             North 
#              (w)
#               ↑
#   West/prev ← • →  East/next
#    (a,h,o)    ↓     (d,l,p)
#              (s)
#             South

# Keys requiring codes
#
# Generally skhd uses "keywords" that map to key names
# (see gh issue: https://github.com/koekeishiya/skhd/issues/1)
# but some keywords dont work (for whatever reason). You might be
# able to use a "keycode". Get the keycode from running `skhd -o`
#
# However they appear to be mutually exclusive, either the keyword
# works as expected and the keycode does not, or the inverse. Generally
# if there is a keyword defined on the gh thread that will work.
#
# It took me a while to see it. All the codes are in the image in
# on the github issue (and page 2-43 in MacintoshToolboxEssentials)
#


# =============
# Mode Handlers
# =============

# DEFAULT (qwerty) = green
# :: default : borders active_color=0xff00ff87 && ya_notify 'Switching to mode: Default' 'skhd'

# COLEMAK (mod-dh) = red
# :: colemkd : borders active_color=0xffff0700 && ya_notify 'Switching to mode: Colemak' 'skhd'


# ==============
# Changing Modes
# ==============

# F19 - Activate DEFAULT mode
# default, colemkd < f19 ; colemkd

# F20 (0x5A) - Activate COLEMAK mode
# default, colemkd < 0x5A ; default

ctrl - right : yabai -m space mouse --focus next
ctrl - left  : yabai -m space mouse --focus prev

ctrl + alt + cmd - h : echo -e "\a"

# .load "config-default.skhd"
# .load "config-colemak.skhd"
